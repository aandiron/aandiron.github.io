# Daddy, Take the Banana


She sat down across from me in the coffee shop. She set her coffee and a banana on the table in front of her. An afternoon snack presumably. I watched her slowly peel back the banana skin leaving the phallic white curve floating in the air in front of her lips.

I looked away. I shouldn't be watching her, it was rude and potentially creepy. I am not a creep. 

But it took much will to drag my eyes from her. She was beautiful. Not beautiful like some model, or beautiful like a "hot chick." She wasn't a girl, she was a _woman_, with all the significance that term could carry. Just about my age. She probably had had a kid or two. That experience had shaped her body into lovely curves and had done nothing to detract from her pretty face, which was enhanced by soft lines that showed wisdom and experience and set off her full, soft lips. She was wearing cute square glasses that doubled-down on her air of wisdom tempered by beauty. On her head she wore a baseball cap against the warm summer sun outside the coffee shop.

But I wasn't going to look at her. I was not going to watch her. I'm not a creep! I raised the book I was reading slightly. As I reached the top of the next page, I discovered that the upper edge of the book framed my view of her, the lower edge of the frame cutting across just above her chest. My eyes scanned the top line of the page once, twice, three times. I was getting nothing from the words. My glance slipped up and I saw that her lips were parted and she was about take that banana into her mouth.

My gut clenched. I tried to look away, back down to my book, I really did. I am not a creep! But my eyes kept defying my better sense of myself by taking repeated quick glances at her.

The glances weren't what I really felt bad about. It wasn't what I was seeing in front of my book, it was what I was seeing in my head that made me feel a wretch.

For in my mind's eye she was on her knees in front of me. And I was looking down at her, her lips parted, the tip of her tongue forward and resting on her lower lip. Waiting for the approach of my throbbing cock in precisely the same way she anticipated the approach of her fruit.

And as in reality her lips, plump and red, formed a tight bond around the meat of the banana, so too in my head her lips slipped open around the head of my cock and closed tightly around the shaft. I could feel her little tongue pressing along the underside of my cock, her lips pushing slowly along the length. I swept the cap from her head and my fingers wove through her soft hair, pushed gently on the back of her head.

Her nostrils flared with my scent, and she made little sounds of satisfaction as I slowly, slowly guided my cock further into her mouth. She was in no rush, but the sight before me as I looked down at her, her lips swollen around my cock half-way consumed, the sensation of her perfect warm mouth gently sucking, the look of satisfaction in her eyes --- it was all too much for me. I came in a matter of seconds, spurting my cum into her pretty mouth.

And then I imagined taking her hand, guiding her to her feet, my hand behind her neck, pulling her in towards me. And on her lips I could taste my cum. And her tongue pushed cum from her mouth into mine --- so much that I was forced to swallow. 

And while I kissed her, I put my hand down her panties. Her pussy wet my fingertips. I held her clit hooked gently on the tip of my finger under I made her cum.

All this passed through my head by the time she had taken two bites of her banana. I wanted to go over to her. I wanted to ask her to come home with me. I wanted to bend her over and fuck her, slide my cock into that pussy of hers that I knew was so very wet and waiting for me.

But when she had finished her banana, I felt shame. I had violated her trust. In my mind I had done such dirty things to her, and all she wanted was to eat her fruit in peace. I didn't want to be creepy, so I said nothing to her. I forced myself to look back down at my book. I forced myself to read the whole page, without comprehension. And when I looked up again, she was gone.
