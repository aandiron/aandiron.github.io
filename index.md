## About

Alan Moore once said "Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words or images, to achieve changes in consciousness... Indeed to cast a spell is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people's consciousness, and this is why I believe that an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world to a shaman."

I'm just trying to successfully execute some magic by conjuring up some weird erotic stories.

But tapping into the shamanistic aspects of writing is extremely challenging. I can't say I love every one of these stories. Nor that they come close to magic. Most, I think, are essentially attempts to cast spells that have misfired. Still, each story that reaches completion has some stuff in it that expresses something a little magical, like a spell that went poof instead of doing what it was supposed to.

These stories also generally attempt to go somewhere that others haven't. There's really weird monsters, interspecies shenanigans, bent realities, and some uncalled-for violence. If I ever manage to successfully cast a spell with these stories, the reader will be left with the feeling that they had a bunch of filthy hirsute metalheads wearing stinking long-unwashed leather tear through their bedrooms on motorcycles with illegal exhaust modifications. If that sounds like the erotica you always searched for but never found, then it may behoove you to follow me. I might not be there yet, but that's where I want to go.
