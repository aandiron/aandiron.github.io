## GWARgasms

I remember you saying with a lot of doubt in your voice: you want me to see GWAR with you? Isn't that the heavy metal band that sprays blood all over the audience?

That's the short way everyone describes them, and while it is true, it doesn't really convey the experience.

What's the "experience" then?

Well, it's more like a puppet show, really. The band is dressed like creatures from outer-space, in huge pieces of foam-rubber armor. And every song they bring out a life-sized puppet of some political figure, or celebrity, or character from their own comic-book universe, and then they behead or eviscerate or otherwise mangle that puppet.

...And then shoot blood all over the audience.

Well, "blood", but really it's just water with red food dye in it. It's not sticky or, you know, thick. My point is: it's not _scary_, it's funny.

Oh, so like comedy-horror, like _Shaun of the Dead_?

Exactly... except maybe a little more low-brow.

_Lower_-brow than... _Shaun of the Dead_...

Yeah. Absolutely. But what I always say is: everyone should see GWAR at least once. They make you feel like other bands aren't even _trying_ to entertain you.

Maybe it went on a little longer than this, but however it happened I managed to eventually win you over and convince you to accompany to GWAR. I remember being pretty excited, because while a GWAR show might be fundamentally silly, it is also a genuinely unforgettable experience. That is, I was excited that I was going to be a part of an experience that you would never forget.

I remember what you wore that night. I had warned you not to wear any clothes you cared about: GWAR has many methods of ruining clothes --- sometimes in unexpected ways. You may not have cared about the clothes you were wearing, but you still managed to look astonishingly good: That old black skirt that came down to your knees, and wasn't too tight to keep you from moving freely, nor so loose that it might get caught and pulled. And that thin wife-beater crop-top that curved over your breasts, and faintly hinted at your nipples poking through. And those very GWAR-practical heavy combat boots. I remember thinking that I couldn't wait until after the show, when I would take you home to our apartment and fuck you silly. But I'm sure you remember... I didn't have to wait quite that long.

Between the opener and GWAR, I remember I took your hand and led you to the front of the venue, inching our way sideways with the occasional, "sorry" or pat on the back until we were just a few people back from the stage. I remember you were nervous, maybe even shaking a little bit? I positioned you in front of me, and put my arms around you and pulled you close to me. You lay your head back on my shoulder. And we waited, swaying lightly, wallowing in the building anticipation that was palpable in the thickening crowd.

The lights came up, and that heavy-metal blast of sound from the stage crashed into us. The explosion of the first song of a metal show is often the best part, when the anticipation of the audience is unleashed and both the band and the audience are at peak energy --- it's a brief moment of climax, something like the feeling of two monster waves colliding. And if you are right up front, you definitely feel like you are riding that wave --- hundreds of people crushing forward toward the ground-shaking cacophony that is pouring off the stage. And that could happen at any decent metal show. But at GWAR, the tectonic movement of the crowd is also lubricated with the high-pressure spray of "blood" that thoroughly soaks anyone within range of the stage. This of course not only drives the crowd into an even wilder frenzy, but also makes it more difficult for people to keep their footing, or grab on to a neighbor. It often seems like the only reason everyone isn't sprawled on the floor is because of the overwhelming, grinding crush of meaty human bodies being pressed together.

I remember in those first few moments you looked back at me with fear in your eyes. But I tensed my muscles and threw out my elbows, and dug in my feet. I held you in position against he push and pull and sway of the crowd. By the end of the first song you realized that while there was no question it was a physically crazy experience, you weren't at (much) risk of having the wind knocked out of you, or a bone broken or any other kind of serious injury.

By the second song, the most aggressive energetic edge had come off the crowd, and you were clearly enjoying yourself. This is about the time that I suspected you were maybe taking the physicality of the experience to another level. Sure, we were being crushed against each other in that pit of blood, but you also pressed your ass back against me, sliding your little hands down my thighs. Though I distinctly remember you seemed to be moving your body, pressing against whomever happened to be in front of you at that moment (man or woman or unspecified, troll or stud or pixie or punk) grinding up against them as much or more than I was being pressed against you by the pressure from behind.

I remember at the breakdown of the second song, when the energy and pressure of the crown relented somewhat, you turned and pulled me down to kiss you. And I slide my hands under the bulbs of your ass, my fingers slipping into the cleft just where the curve of your ass meets the top of your legs --- that spot that I know turns you on so much --- and I lifted you, and you threw your legs around me and I took advantage of the pressure of the crowd to press your body hard against mine, until I could feel your nipples against my chest through my wet t-shirt. 

We kissed long and wetly.

Then you broke off the kiss, and pulled back and wiped the blood raining down from your eyes with the back of your hands. And I looked at your pretty eyes with drops of blood clinging to your eyelashes and at your plump parted lips and your pretty face streaked with blood and I thought you were never more beautiful.

The next song was one of GWAR's real bangers, and the pressure in the crowd surged again with renewed energy. You were back in front of me, and my arms were around you again. But after your kiss, I was severely turned on. I'm sure you could feel my cock pressing against your ass. And with my hands on your exposed belly, it was a small matter before I was slipping my fingers up under your shirt and cupping your breasts, and twisting your nipples in time to the music.

That's when I felt your hand rubbing my cock through my pants. And that's when I knew I wouldn't be able to stop myself from taking this whole situation way too far, even if it might embarrass a few of the people nearest to us --- I no longer cared, I wanted to fuck you right there.

I slipped my hands up your thighs lifting your skirt until I could hitch my thumbs over the waist of your panties and slide them down over your ass and down your legs. And then with a lot of wiggling and some awkward leaning and a few steps, and a risky maneuver on your part that almost ended up with you on the floor, we got those panties free of your boots. I remember thinking: someone after the show is going to find that soaked and dyed and trampled pair of panties somewhere on this floor and they will wonder how that happened, and then think for a moment and guess _exactly_ how that happened.

I had your skirt up, and my pants undone, and I tried to be discreet, I really did. I tried to keep your skirt covering what we were doing as best I could, but really, I just didn't care. I sipped my cock into you from behind.

You were so fucking wet. Soaked all over.

Then I was fucking you while we were surrounded by people on every side. We could feel the heat and the sweat coming off them, and the cold blood raining down on us. And every time the crowd pressed forward, I thrust deeper into you. I had one fingertip on your clit and the other hand tightly gripping your tit under your shirt.

I remember yelling in your ear, so you could hear me over the blast of heavy metal: you realize probably every person around us knows I'm fucking you right now, right? Probably half of them feel me thrusting into you, you know that right?

You nodded, with your eyes closed, and biting your lip.

I suspect that to this day you have no notion of how in love with you I was in that one wild wet moment.

And then I remember you shaking violently against me, biting your lip harder, and I knew you were cumming, and that made me cum. And in a weird coincidence just at that moment, GWAR leaned over one of their decapitated puppets that was spraying blood and hit us both right in the face and chest.

I remember feeling like we were both swimming in sweat and blood and pussy and cum.
