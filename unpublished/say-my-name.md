## Say my Name

It's hardly ever talked about, but everyone instinctively knows there's power in saying someone's name. It's so well known that it is a trope in sitcoms: someone says the wrong name out loud when two characters are kissing, shenanigans ensue. It's a trope, but the power is real. The person who speaks the wrong name in the wrong moment in real life can destroy things.

But saying a name has the power to create as well as destroy. It's a deeply human thing to whisper aloud the name of the person you fantasize about being with. Often not just once, but many times, sometimes repeating until it becomes almost a chant. And what is that if not an attempt at manifestation? We're all naked and alone in our beds, whispering the name of the one we long to be with, and maybe we all know that isn't going to make them suddenly appear radiantly before us, but when we close our eyes and chant a name we are absolutely trying to summon the subconscious version of that person up from the liminal dream space and into our present consciousness. And the effect is real. With enough chanting, the presence of the person arrives, and that affects you physically: that presence makes your body _move_.

When I close my eyes and say your name, it pulls the dream-you to me. I say your name and you are stripping your clothes off for me. I say your name and you are naked in the bed with me, spreading your legs. I say your name and I can feel your lips against mine, my hands slipping over your thighs, your curves under my hands, your body pressed tightly against me. I say your name and you make me cum.

I like to think you are doing the same. You say my name, you say it over and over. You say it in a breathy whisper because somehow that makes it more potent. You say my name and the dream-me pops into your head. And when you say my name, you know the dream-me wants nothing but you, and you know it because I'm naked and hard above you, whispering my desire for you into your ear. You say my name and open your legs to take me in and dream-me fully _takes_ you. Carries you off to another place where it is just you and me, and you know that you are the only thing I ever wanted. And in that place I wanted you so badly that when you say my name all you can feel is me inside you, pressing every aspect of my dream-being into you until you cum saying my name.
