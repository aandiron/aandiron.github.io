## Glazed

Steel bowl. Powdered sugar. Whisk. Pure vanilla extract. Rubber spatula. I touch my thumb to each of my fingers.

'You can remove your clothes and find a comfortable way to sit on that stool there. Don't slouch, I need you to be upright, in something of a statuesque pose. It's important that you to find a position you can hold without moving, or it won't come out right.

'Relax for the moment. Think about your breathing. I want you to get to a point where you can comfortably remain absolutely still when I apply the glaze.'

I pour the sugar into the bowl and add a little warm water while the whisk flicks a few turns around the bowl. In goes a bit of the vanilla accompanied by the inevitable whiff reaching up to my nose. She watches the muscles of my forearm spin the whisk around vigorously as the mixture clouds and thickens. She shivers in the cool of the large kitchen, and I see goosebumps rise on her arms.

'I made the mixture slightly warm, so it should be comfortable against your skin. But you'll have to remain still while it sets up.'

The whisk comes up from the bowl and the liquid sugar drips from it in a slowly sliding viscous thread. I am pleased with the consistency.

'Now. Are you relaxed? Are you comfortable? Breathe slowly. Hold still.'

She breathes softly through her nose, though her full lips are slightly parted. I hold the spatula lightly, far back on the handle. I dip it into the bowl and come up with a line of glaze clinging along the tip. This I touch to her lower lip. 

'Does it taste right?'

The tip of her tongue slips wetly along her lip. She doesn't say anything, apparently not wishing to disturb her relaxed state, but I see the assent in her eyes.

The spatula hangs in the air level with those large, lovely, languid eyes. I'm inattentive, and a drop that had slowly gathered mass to itself escapes the squared angle of the spatula to fall on her thigh. Inspired, another quickly follows after its brethren.

I look down, dismayed to see the smooth curve of her thigh spoiled with such depraved splattering. I wanted glassy-smooth perfection, not a sticky dripping mess.

'One moment. I must take care of that.'

I use a warm wet cloth to remove the offending splats from the top of her thigh. It leaves behind its own sheen of a path, but that will soon dry.

'Back to work now.' I stir the glaze in the bowl with the spatula, scraping the sides down to clear shining steel. Up I come with quite a bit more on the end this time --- but not too much. It is quite akin to getting the correct amount of paint on a brush.

I touch the loaded spatula to a place on her chest, between her breast, directly above her heart. Three fingers of my left hand rise to meet the dramatic curve under her left breast. She is so still, so good at her job, that this gesture of stabilization is unnecessary. At least on her part. For my own, the steadying of the object with my left hand somehow seems to transmit --- a communication that runs up one arm, across my chest and down the other --- across my body to smooth the motions of my right hand, which guides the spatula. In one fluid motion, I move the end of the spatula upward, tracing her perfect breast. Over the top it goes, and down the outside curve. As it comes around and under, I withdraw my fingers from where they touched her.

She is looking at my face now, watching me concentrate as I work. But she remains absolutely still and quiet, warm-flesh stone. I step back, tipping the spatula into the air, judging the qualities of my first stroke. 

I am satisfied. Though I have a hard time separating what is the quality of my work from the perfect qualities of her breasts. Nothing for it but to continue onward. On to the serious business.

I re-load the spatula and this time center the edge of it directly on the tip of her nipple. I slowly, carefully circle her nipple, moving outward in a spiral, painting in the space between her nipple and the first stroke. And now I am truly impressed by her ability to remain still.

Trying a different tack, I come back from the bowl and move directly to address her other nipple. But I made a mistake and added too much to the spatula. The glaze arrives on the upper side of her nipple too thickly, and wetly. In a sticky white glob it falls from her nipple, and this time lands on her inner thigh. And too much there! It starts sliding down between her legs. Quickly I find my warm cloth and dab up the error. 'Sorry about that. Thank you for remaining so still with all my clumsiness.'

I decide boldness is called for. I take slightly more onto the spatula, but I move more quickly now. With a steady hand, I slip the end of the spatula over the curve of the still unpainted breast, and then fill in the lovely gap between them. With big dashing strokes, I glaze up her chest, over her shoulders a bit, and up her neck to her jaw. Back I go into the bowl, becoming excited as the sugar begins to harden along her breasts where it was first applied. I start another stroke from from her belly and paint up to where her breast swells out above --- carefully, carefully filling in the complex curve-on-curve underside of her breast with an even, smooth coat.

I step back again. All along her chest and breasts the sugar is becoming opaque and white, but still glistens with moisture. But it is quickly becoming stiff, soon to be at risk of cracking. Where it is still warm and wet and has not dried, it is more translucent --- along her belly, her neck, the still-wet spots along her the lowest curves of her breasts. It's shockingly beautiful to me. The way ice formed over a jagged rock face is so compelling that one can barely look away. Except that this is a different kind of underlying structure. Not a cold sharp rock, but the living, curving hot body of someone's mother. The words here are not enough. I should have taken a picture.

But what have I really done here except add a patina to something that was already a perfect shape? Maybe there is nothing I can do about that. I can't _improve_ her form, and this was not about trying to. I've achieved nothing except to attempt an extraordinarily selfish act: to wire the perfect form of her actual physical existence into the abstracted fuzzy version of it that exists in my mind and occupies and disproportionately enormous share of my mental capacities.

I feel wholly unsuccessful.
