## Pompoir

### Or, The Douche

On our third date I told her, "You know, you really have an exceptionally pretty face."

She stirred her drink and half-grinned at me, "If you keep saying nice things to me, you're going to have a very good night."

"I'm not flattering you --- well, not _just_ flattering you --- objectively, you are beautiful. You can ask anyone in this bar."

Seriously, it wasn't just flattery. I admit it freely: I'm kind of a sucker for a pretty face. Both in a purely aesthetic way --- I enjoy admiring beautiful things  --- and also in a filthy way --- I look at her face, with those big eyes and full lips, and it's not long before I imagine her hungrily sucking my cock; drenching that pretty face of hers in my cum.

My weakness for her pretty face is maybe the reason we've made it to our third date. Overall, I'd say she was a little less attractive than the women I typically date. I imagine twenty years ago, armed with youth and that beautiful face, she was probably an 11 on the 10-point hotness scale. But these days, forty-something and after having a kid, she had faded to somewhere just a little above average. Maybe I shouldn't judge a woman on looks, but hey, at least I date women my own age, unlike many men in my position!

Though that brings me to another strike against her: we're really not from the same class. She's a nurse, with a teenager at home in a small apartment somewhere in the more suburban parts of the city. I'm an executive with a high six-figure salary and I live in a full-floor luxury condo high in a residential tower. As for looks, I have a strict regimen of running, riding, and lifting that keeps me, frankly, ripped. 

In short, I'm out of her league.

But the dates had been genuinely fun, and as I said, I did think she was pretty. Maybe we would work out as actual friends in the long run. In the short term, I was feeling pretty horny tonight, so I decided I would fuck her, if she was similarly inclined.

We made it without incident from the bar to my apartment. I flipped the lights on when we walked in the door, but she asked me to turn them off again as she looked out the floor-to-ceiling windows at the city.

"The view is amazing."

"Even before I made any money, I always said that a view is one thing worth spending money on."

"This place must cost a fortune."

"As I said, worth spending money on."

She nodded and turned from the windows to look at me. "Do you have a handkerchief? Or a bandanna maybe?"

"Top drawer, over there."

She found a bandanna and folded it into a long strip and reached up (she was fairly short, in a way that I found endearing) and tied it around my eyes.

"Blindfolded?"

"Take your clothes off and lay on the bed."

"Yes ma'am." I had enough experience with kink that I was not afraid to let a woman who wanted to take control tell me what to do. Maybe this would be a more fun evening than I had anticipated!

A minute later I felt her warm naked body pressing up against my side. I could feel the curve of her breast pressing against my arm, and soft smooth thigh laying above mine. I felt her take my cock in her warm hand, and she started stroking me slowly. Apparently she had used some oil she had tucked away somewhere, because her hand slipped slickly up and down my cock, which rapidly grew hard at her touch.

"Mmmm." I said, though what I was thinking was: Really? A blindfolded handjob? I hope that's not her idea of the culmination of a 'very good night.' The last thing I needed this evening was a modest prude.

Though, I reflected after a minute or two, she was _really_ good at this handjob thing. I don't mind a woman occasionally stroking my cock, but I had never cum from a handjob before. Generally, women just don't know how to do it correctly. This was different though, she had just the right grip in just the right place on my cock, stimulating the head, but not too much, and the oil made it feel as warm and wet as any pussy. And I was enjoying the feeling of her naked body pressed against me, writhing with the rhythm of stroking me off. I realized that she probably could make me cum --- this was, in fact, the best handjob I had ever received. I suddenly had the first inklings of my soon-to-be massive respect for her skills. 

For it turned out that the handjob was just a warm up, something to tease me to a nice rock hard edge-of-cumming place before she climbed up and straddled me. Now remember, I was blindfolded, so I _felt_ her straddle me: her warm inner thighs spreading across my hips, her warm, oil-slick hands pressing against the muscles of my chest. But I wasn't seeing anything. Through the sheer skill of her touch, she had heated my desire to fuck her to a rolling boil.

I felt her take my cock in her hand between her legs, and she guided me to her wet pussy, playing my cock against her so I could feel the warm wetness, and then letting the head slip inside. She slide herself slowly, slowly downward, and then slowly back up, and down again, slicking me with her wetness. My cock throbbed inside her.

Then she stopped moving entirely.

She put her hands on the tense muscles of my abdomen, and held herself just slightly above me, with most of my cock still inside her. And, while holding very still, she flexed some muscles that I didn't know women even had, some combination of pelvis and abdomen muscles. Her pussy gripped and slipped on my cock, even though she didn't move her hips at all. I tried to move my pelvis the way I would typically thrust into a woman who was on top, riding me.

"No, don't move. This is my show," she said.

It took a mighty effort of will to resist the urge to thrust my cock as deeply up into her as I can. She had so quickly driven me to the point where the desire to fuck her mercilessly is overwhelming.

And again, remember: I can't see her. Basically the only sensory input I have is her pussy sucking wetly at my cock with a grip and motion unlike anything I have ever experienced before. I slid my hands along her upper thighs to her hips, with every intention of pulling her down onto my cock.

She grabbed my wrists and held my hands away from her. "Don't touch me, I need to concentrate."

Now I can think of nothing else except the way her pussy felt squeezing and working my cock. I can't hold out. She's making me cum. My whole sexual life flashes before my eyes, and I realize what a stupid fucking fool I have been: all the hot women in skimpy outfits, the "kinky" leatherware, whips and boots, short skirts and nipples poking through thin material, pounding a cute ass from behind, the snapshots, the videos, the porn, and yes, cumming on pretty faces --- all of it had been the context of the mistaken idea that _visuals_ were what makes sex hot. 

Visuals were nothing, I now realized, it was all about _experience_.

And this experience, the way this woman was making me cum --- while I was stone still and she was barely moving except somewhere deep inside her that pulled at me, that milked my cock with an uncanny rhythm --- was unlike anything else I ever experiences before. 

I have a massive orgasm, spurting long and hard and deeply inside her, my balls clenching with the effort of firing cum up into her. And as I cum she sinks down onto my cock and holds herself there, taking the whole thrusting load.

"My god, what _was_ that?" I gasped when I could breathe again.

"Oh, that was my _pompoir_. Did you enjoy that? It took years of practice to learn."

"I... my... never..." I had no words.

She climbed off me and curled up warmly naked against my side again. I pulled the blindfold off. I ran my hands over her body and thought about her and what I wanted to do for her now: I wanted to make her cum as hard as she had just made me cum. 

Not as a simple repayment or tit-for-tat. I wanted to give her an experience unlike anything she had ever had before, as she had done for me. She had just opened a portal of pleasure in my mind that I didn't know had existed, and I would now never be able to close. More than anything else at that moment, I wanted to be able to give her the same gift. I wanted to burn myself permanently into her sexual desires and fantasies.

But I knew the best move I had was maybe a little cunnilingus. I'll bet I could make her cum by licking her pussy, and I knew I damn sure was going to try as hard as I could. But deep down I also knew --- unlike her --- I was nothing special. Just another dude clumsily trying to eat her out.

I knew she was out of my league.
