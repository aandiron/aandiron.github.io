## (untitled: Sex Object)

I am writing these lines because I don't expect to ever leave this place. This will be my record, if anyone ever wonders what became of me. Particularly you, who I left behind so long ago --- I hope you read this some day, and maybe understands a little of what has become of me.

Let me be clear, I do not expect to ever _want_ to leave, but even if I did, getting here was such a challenge --- hiring a guide, bribing the guards, passing through that murky tunnel, over the razor wire and past the fortifications --- that I cannot imagine making the return journey even if I wanted to.

And having arrived here, the security apparatus with which they have chosen to surround this place does not seem at all inappropriate or unnecessary. People _should_ be kept out of here. It is not a place for (living) humans.

The mystery of how this place came to be, or how it functions is beyond my grasp. Beyond anyone's grasp, I believe. Even our finest physicists and philosophers would simply stand in wonder, or perhaps horror, of this place if they were permitted to examine it.

But I suppose it is incumbent on me to try to give some explanation, since so few have been to where I am, or are likely to ever be. It may be of benefit to others to read these words some day.

The only way I can think to explain it is that in this place, particularly in the abandoned small city in the center of this place, the Platonic Forms of objects,  that is, the metaphysical version of objects, or the idealized conceptual non-thing that represents all instances of an object, has in some way been allowed to bleed into reality.

So, say you come across a chair in some empty office in the city. It may look like any other office chair, but as soon as you touch it, perhaps to swivel it to face the seat towards you, you will feel the thing _shimmer_ --- that's the only word I have for it --- and as you sit, you will, for a moment, feel the object shift under you, and then a moment later you realize it is not just an office chair, but it is a physical manifestation of the ultimate office chair that is now supporting you body in a way that you never thought possible.

More than just a generalized Platonic Form though, you soon realize that the chair on which you sit cannot be idealized for all the world, but is in fact an idealized form for you personally: surely the lumbar curve that matches your spine so well could not be the same for another person. The precision with which the padding molds to your body must be yours alone. You become very aware that this object that seemed such a mundane commodity on first glance is actually the ultimately perfect "chair" object for you.

So what's the problem? I can hear you ask. Why not open up this experience for everyone? A kind of thinking-person's amusement park, perhaps. The problem is the _despair_ that comes with it. I have it on good authority that you cannot take any idealized object with you. When you roll the office chair back to your own office it will simply be a shitty office chair once again. And once you've sat on the idealized chair, all others seem like simple garbage. All other non-idealized versions of things lose their value. You becomes surrounded by meaningless, purposeless, junk.

The despair is particularly profound with the consumables: once you've have finished a piece of fruit in this place, say an apple, you sink inevitably into a deep depression with the realization that you will never taste an apple like that again.

So, as I say, the surrounding layers of razor wire and machine gun emplacements are a good thing for humanity. As someone who now has intimate inside knowledge, who knows the engulfing despair of this place, I urge all the authorities to keep the restrictions in place! 

But, I hear you ask now, why do I remain? Why should I not try to escape if the despair is so great? Even if I died trying to get back out, at least that would be some relief, correct?

I will not lie, the temptation comes to me almost daily. But I do not go, because I found _the_ object I came here looking for. And it keeps me satisfied in some small way, enough that I do not want to die, and do not want to leave.

I think it must be universal that when people hear rumors of this place and what occurs here, it must be the pleasures that could be experienced to which the imagination immediately wanders. And while I'm sure that, given the opportunity, there are many who genuinely would come here looking to experience the pleasure of the ideal apple, there must be many more whose prurient thoughts go first towards the sexual experiences that might be had, though perhaps those folks are not so vocal as the gastronomes.

However, I admit that I am among those deviants myself. I came here looking for the ultimate sex object, though I confess that I did have any idea what that might actually be.

It is the nature of this place that the thing you might be looking for does not typically make itself quickly available. It seems that _searching_ is part of the process for finding that idealized form you seek. So if you were here after that apple I mentioned above, you might have gotten a tip on a location of an old orchard. But when you found the spot, you might find it barren of trees. And yet, if you keep looking with some persistence, you might instead find a forgotten apple tree in the back yard of some row house, hidden from the street and forgotten now by all people. It would be your tree alone. Though there is a reasonable chance that you may find only a single apple growing upon it.

But the apple-seeker at least has an idea of what they might be looking for. I came to this place only with the desire to satisfy my sexual cravings, and little more specific beyond that. I'm not sure what I thought I might find in this place. Perhaps an abandoned whore-house full of ghosts or something.

I am not some pervert or purely hedonistic pleasure-seeker. But I have noticed that regardless of the quality of your relationship with another human being, the initial lust always seems to fade. Or, at least it does for me. I came to this place simply to try to find an answer to the question: why must this be so? Why can't I find lust that lasts eternally?

For two weeks I searched. Imagine how hard this was! Two _weeks_ of daily stumbling across the most idealized Forms of things: the perfect spoon, the perfect pillow, the perfect book --- I began to amass a collection of objects that I simply could not leave behind and carried around with me on my quest. (I was pleasantly surprised to find I could re-read the book and it was just as satisfying a second time as it was on the first, for it was a perfect book after all.) Other things --- like the perfect tree and that damnable office chair --- I have, by sheer force of will, managed to leave behind, driven by my single-minded desire to find perfect lust.

And I'll tell you: I _did_ find it. In a sixth-floor room of an empty hotel in the heart of what had been the commercial district. 

I had been meticulously going through the rooms of the building --- a hotel just felt like the right place to find lust. It had become a rote exercise. I was expecting nothing, just poking my head through doors, seeing nothing but the sundry flotsam and jetsam of an abandoned hotel in room after room. But when I got to that sixth-floor room, when I opened the door, there she was. With the late afternoon sunlight coming through the window behind her. At first all I could see was her silhouette, a vision of curves. But my eyes adjusted and I could then see her clearly, dressed in a yellow sun dress that came down to her thighs. 

She looked like you, of course, but you on your very best day, lithe and warm and smiling. She held back for a second, and then jumped on me, wrapping her legs around me, pressing her breasts against my chest, and kissing me deeply with those full, perfect, idealized lips. It was a matter of moments before I had the sundress up over her head and I laid her back to fuck her on the edge of that dusty bed in the hotel room. And just as I came inside her, the sun set and I looked around and she was gone.

After that first time, I would go back to that room, nearly every day, usually around sunset. She was always there. And you might think that being some idealized form of lust, she was always ready to fuck me. But that isn't how lust works. At least not for me. 

Perhaps the most idealized part of her was that she could somehow convince me every day, through various subtleties and sleights, that she probably would _not_ have me that day. She would often kiss me, and then turn and step away from me, forcing me to pursue her. She was a perfect tease, as if she knew exactly what was required to make me feel like I could not possess her, and thus building up my desire to possess her, and then when it seemed like this day might have a bleak outcome of unrequited lust, she would suddenly bestow her deeper and more closely-held desires upon me.

For instance, I opened the door one day and she was wearing a thin sweater of a tight purple material, and a pair of panties. The sweater curved over her breasts and her nipples poked out in prominent bumps from the peaks of her great rounded tits. When she saw me at the door she rushed forward and pushed me back into the hallway and closed the door in my face. I waited a moment, and tried the door knob again. She had not locked it. I slowly opened the door and she was looking right at me, sliding her hand up her belly, and lifting the sweater slowly until I could see the curve of her tits under the edge of the rising hemline. I closed the door behind me and she dropped to her knees as the sweater came up and over her head and I could see her naked and perfect tits. She took my cock from my pants and admired it while sliding the tip of her tongue along her lips. And then she plunged into the most heated blowjob I have ever experienced. When I came, she let my cock slip from her lips and with a few strokes of her small, pretty hand I spurted all over her breasts.

One day I entered the room, and I could hear water running in the bath. I quietly opened the door to the bathroom, and there she lay in the tub, entirely nude, her pert nipples atop her full breasts that rose above the level of the water. Her belly flat and curving slightly away underneath. Her naked thighs slightly spread so I could see her perfect pussy clearly. 

When she saw my face at the door, she leaped up with a look of unmitigated anger, and snatched a towel from the rack to drape around her naked body. I stepped back, but when I looked again, I could see her fingers peeping out from under the lower edge of the towel. She was rubbing her clit, and she looked up at me and opened her eyes, and let out a long sigh. Needless to say I stepped forward and lowered her down to the warm water. She spread her legs and let me into her and I fucked her in that bathtub with such vehemence that we flooded the floor.

And then there was the sex itself. Putting my cock in her was unlike anything I ever experienced before. Her pussy is a warm, tight, wet place. As with all things in this place, perfectly accommodating my cock in all ways. Her flesh is warm and meaty and satisfying under my fingers, but retains that shimmer of the other idealized objects here. I have the sense that her body shifts in my hands, somehow both of the flesh and incorporeal. Her body shifts to be the most resiliently fuckable thing it could be to satisfy my mind, and my dick. Sometimes, when sensation is at its peak, her body disappears entirely, leaving just her tight wet pussy or pillowy lips sliding up and down my cock in a touch of purest physical pleasure.

And she knows _how_ to fuck, in such a way as it was like her job to bring me off, which perhaps it was. She would climb atop me on the bed and lean over while my cock slipped slowly into her. And then she would sit up and slide farther down on my cock than I would have thought possible. And she would fuck me by rolling her hips back and forth, grinding her clit against my body, until she came with a wild orgasm, and seeing her cum would make me cum, shooting deep up inside her pussy while aggressively twisting her little nipples between my fingers.

This has gone on for months now. Every day it is like discovering lust anew. Every day a perfect satisfaction of my physical desires. It is why I cannot leave now. Would you be able to turn away from such pleasure and satisfaction?

But there is, of course, a catch. A catch that, while I am wholly satisfied and satiated in my desires, still leaves me miserable, lonely, and full of the despair this place ladles onto the weak humans who try to come here. And that catch is this: the _objects_ here may be idealized Forms --- perfect _things_. But there are no _people_ here. By whatever mechanism that makes this place work, there's no part of it that creates perfect people. The woman in the room is not a perfect woman. She is not, I realize now, a woman at all. She is a thing. She is nothing but a sex object. She satisfies all my lust in a way that no individual instantiation of a real woman ever could. At the same time, that's _all_ she is, or ever will be. There is no other part to her, except the lust. And more than that, she is not, and never could be, you.
