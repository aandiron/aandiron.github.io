## dark of the moon

It had come in the night your entire life. Always on the dark of the moon. It was so familiar that you never found anything to be afraid of, even though you knew other people did not have the same experience.

When you were a small girl, it would come on those dark nights, and slip into your bed with you, and it was a huge, comforting (though black) presence. It curled up beside you, and held your small body in its big black paws, and it told you in those words-that-were-not-words it spoke that you never had anything to fear, that it had been there before you and would be there after you, and you would both be together, on the dark of the moon, for all time.

As you grew older, when it came on those nights during the dark of the moon, it was somehow larger and darker still. You had grown a little, but its paw-hands had grown much more. It would come in the room in the night, when you were most soundly asleep, and its hugeness would black out the world above you. And it would lift your little body and cradle you, and you would feel small and safe. But your young body would react in sometimes strange ways to its touch. You could feel the pads of its paw-fingers all over you, and it made your body feel things, physical things, that were wholly new to it. Dangerous, maybe, but exhilarating. You came to look forward to those dark-of-the-moon nights. You left your door open and your sheets untucked --- as if any physical barrier would slow its approach to you in any way. Still, it seemed to appreciate the gesture.

Then it was a short time, within some specific year, though you can't remember precisely which, that the touch of the thing on the dozen or so nights it came to you, got more aggressive. You could feel it wanting to take. It would whisper in its word-not-words about how it had been waiting all these years for this body of yours to be ready, and that perhaps this was the finest body you had ever possessed, so please forgive it for trying to be hasty and move things along. It whispered to you about how it could not wait for you to grow up. And by the end of that year, you had.

Now when it comes to you, it comes full of aggression and lust. It comes on those dark nights and sweeps away the rest of the world from your mind. It owns you, and it would have it no other way. The thing is massive now. It comes slinking into the room through the shadows and into your bed, and it wakes you gently and then it is over and above you, giant and black --- becoming your entire universe. And it seethes and growls, it forces your legs apart and your tits together, it throws your hands above your head, or behind your back. It enters into you, and swells and fills you and then falls backward, like a cloud of stars falling backward into a nebula before there is re-birth and it comes flowing back into you. And then you can feel its huge paw-fingers on your breasts, twisting your nipple in one hand while some kind of raspy black tongue plays over your other. And the hugeness of the thing comes up between your legs and you grip it tightly and it whispers word-not-words about how much it lusts for your touch, how you are the only one who has the capacity to handle the thing. This is why it comes back to you time after time, body after body, age after age. And you always make a space in your brief mortal life for the thing. After all, it doesn't ask much, a mere dozen nights or so each year. And it gives you so much.

Your husband, your family, has no idea of course. That time of the month, you usually make an excuse and sleep on the couch. You always know which night it will come. Certainly your husband must have witnessed the strange twistings in the bed next to him on a few occasions. But if so, he never said anything about it to you. Somehow he must have guessed that this thing was bigger than him (both metaphysically and literally) and your husband must have known that in the grand scheme of things he was just borrowing you for a short time, and made his peace with that.

The coming of the thing, in its regularly lunar cycle over the years, never interfered with your feelings about your husband. You just always know that somewhere, the biggest piece of you belonged to something much bigger than your husband, your home, your family, or even this world.

And every dark of the moon, you feel lucky to get a little taste of that hugeness, and it makes you feel whole.
