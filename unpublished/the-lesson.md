# Why I Need to Pay Attention in Class

Why do I need to pay attention in class? Well, maybe because if I don't, I end up having to stay after school and write a stupid essay like this one.

But as I was trying to tell you before: I _do_ pay attention in class. I pay attention to _you_. After all, you are easily the hottest teacher in school. You're a hot little MILF. Or maybe a TILF? I know you want me. You say I wasn't paying attention, but I _saw_ you, when you thought nobody else was looking, when you leaned over and mouthed the words "I want to suck your cock" to me.

Or hell, maybe you said it out loud. I had my earbuds in, so I wouldn't have heard you. My point is, I _was_ paying attention though. I was paying attention to those beautiful full lips of yours, and you wanting to suck my cock? How could I not pay attention to that!

I was paying so much attention that you gave me an instant boner. I mean I had like a baseball bat in my pants, and I needed to hit some ~~shit~~ stuff.

I paid attention! I couldn't take my eyes off you, with those cute glasses and the shirt with the all the buttons down the front that curve out over your big hot titties. Like I said, I wanted to hit that! I started imagining like you were down on your knees, looking up at me. And you had my cock in your pretty little hand, and your fingers can't reach the whole way around it because I'm so thick and big. And you look up at me and say (out loud this time): "yeah, you know I want it: I want to suck your cock."

And then you slip your lips over my cock and you're trying to suck all of me into you.

I gather your hair and pull it back from your face, but really this is just a move to get my hand on the back of your head, where I press down until you start gagging.

But I'm not a dick! I let you come up for air. My cock slips from your lips and a long string of saliva hangs between your lower lip and the tip of my throbbing dick and there's tears in your eyes behind your cute glasses. So I take your glasses off and fold them and set them on my desk. And you say, "don't make me gag or I _won't_ want to suck your cock." And, you know, I'm not a dick, so I'm like "yeah, sure." 

And then you go back down on my big guy, like you're starving for it, sliding those big full lips up and down my glistening shaft. And like with every stroke you go a little deeper. But what's really hot is that like with every stroke your like moaning with my cock in your mouth, like as if _you_ are the one getting off.

So I think about ripping your shirt open, because I want to see your titties. And your little buttons go flying and I slide my hand down your bra and your tit is big and warm and curvy, and your nipple is pressing against the palm of my hand, all hard like one of those buttons. And you reach up and slide your shirt down over your shoulders, and undo your bra and throw it aside, all without ever stopping suck on me.

Seeing your titties is too much for me. Your titties make me cum when I think about you fully dressed! Undressed is like a whole nother level. So I'd want to cum on them. I would pull my dick back and hold the tip down and shoot my cum right between your tits. I'd make a rushing river of cum right down the canyon of your titties.

See? I was totally paying attention to you in class. Are you kidding? I couldn't look away from you. But thinking about how you wanted to suck me off left me having to do something. And since I sit in the back row, I figured I could be sneaky about it. And I'll tell you what I actually did in class today: without ever taking my eyes off you up there at the front teaching away, I undid my fly and pulled out my dick. And I stroked it off quietly right there under the desk, thinking about you sucking it the whole time. And you really did make me cum, but most of it ended up on the underside of my desk instead of between your tits.

And now you're sitting up there at the front of the room, still looking all hot and MILFY in your glasses and your buttons. And when I hand this in, maybe you'll read it, and then maybe you can reinforce this little lesson of why I should be paying more attention in class.
