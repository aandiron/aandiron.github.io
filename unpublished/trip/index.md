# (Untitled story)

The dose is too much for my weak soul, but I did not know that in the beginning.

I select a book, _Inferno_, and lay on the couch. But I can not read, I can not form images in my head. My mind has slipped entirely out into the physical world, but the physical world is no longer _real_. The words melt on the page, and there is no "book" there, no images, no ideas.

There is too much light. I stuff cloth into the cavity of a pair of goggles and strap them over my eyes. I lay back and close my eyes behind the blacked out goggles. Somehow the light still seeps in, through the cracks and the thin spots of my goggle contraption. It aggravates me. I yank the goggles from my eyes, stuff another layer of cloth in, and tighten the straps on my head.

I close my eyes again, and this time I find true darkness. Nothingness and nothing but blackness there. I peer in, focus my eyes. In the darkness, there is color. And from the center of the color, where the dark-color is darkest, I see her emerge, as if she were matter escaping the event horizon and conglomerating together with glowing energy.

She moves towards me.

She is darkness itself. Pure lust and evil. Her edges do not resolve. She has no edges, no contours, no settled form. She shifts in time to my desires, shaping herself to draw me in. And since she is the only thing that exists there in the blackness, I have no will or power to resist her gravity. I fall towards her.

She opens herself towards me. Now she is pale and glowing in the darkness. Her form takes on curves that reflect my cravings. Tits form into the palms of my hands. Her lips fill and spread and she kisses me. She presses herself against me, and I can feel her cold naked belly pressing against my hard cock. She is beautiful and frightening, meek and destructive.

I slide my hands down her back, and her ass curves into my hands. I pull her hard against me, feeling the heaviness of her gravity, like I will never be able to separate myself from her again. She is hot and dark and slippery and writhing in my grip.

I know you think this is all in my head. But it is the opposite. There is _nothing_ in my head. It is all out there. I have left my head, my mind, my body behind. I am aware only of the exterior physical world and all the details and resolution that it is made of. And the only thing in that physical world is her. Make no mistake, she is nothing _but_ real.

She lowers herself to her knees, and takes the shaft of my swollen purple cock in her small hand. She looks up at me and says in an ethereal voice, "I want to choke on you," and slips her soft lips over the tip. I hold her head in my hands and watch her pale face sliding down the length of my cock. Deeper and deeper my cock falls down her bottomless throat. It seems like it will stretch on forever towards infinity.

But my cock must land somewhere inside her, because I now hear her choking and gagging, spitting and spurting. And yet still her head slides downwards on me, taking ever more in. Her hand, gloved in black liquid, slips between her thighs and I watch her make herself cum with my cock in her mouth.

I so desperately want to fill her mouth with my cum. But, as I said, I have no presence inside my body. I cannot feel my cock at all, despite the fact that it seems to be raging and throbbing with pleasure before my eyes. It is as detached and separated from my mind as the rest of my body. I no longer have any mental capacity left for my self. All my attention is on the exterior physical world, and since that world is entirely made up of her, my attention is all on her. I decide that my mission is to forget myself and simply make her cum as many times as I can.

She withdraws her small, pretty mouth from my cock and looks up at me. A stream of sticky multi-colored liquid arcs across the space between her lips and my cock. She is covered in sticky liquid. Or perhaps she herself is formed from demoniacal black goo.

She pushes me back, straddles me, and lowers herself onto my cock. She is wet. So wet that she seems to be spurting liquid. Perhaps she is _made_ of liquid, I can not tell for sure. My hands slip along the cool round edge of her ass, and then my hands fall into her ass, for it too is liquid. My hands are consumed, and she cums again, slipping her white body up and down along my cock, splashing wetly on my hands and forearms.

Now I push her back without withdrawing myself. I step back and watch as my cock slips deep into her and her fingers find her clit. She cums with a wet spurting orgasm that washes over her first, and then all over me.

She pulls herself slowly, slowly off my cock, as if she is fighting a tremendous suction that is holding us together. She stands and turns and bends. As she does, the curves of her hips, the back of her thighs, the arch of her pale naked back, all assemble themselves before me. Her perfect ass has reformed and taken shape again. The curves of her body obsess me, I can not look away. Compulsion to fuck her overwhelms me. I want to destroy myself making her cum. 

She is covered in liquid of various colors that splashes over her pearl-white skin. Color shines wetly in her black hair. I slide into her from behind and she screams out into the abyss, her voice taking colorful and erotic shape in the blackness. I take her hips in my hands and feel the solidness of her bone under my fingers. Solid enough that I can pull her hard back onto my cock. I rape her skeletal form and the liquid curves of flesh that slide along it.

![acidtrip8.png](./acidtrip8.png "I take her hips in my hands and feel the solidness of her bone under my fingers. Solid enough that I can pull her hard back onto my cock.")

And I tell you, that all my consciousness remains entirely absorbed with her. I still cannot feel my cock at all, numb and distant as it is, though I am thrilled that apparently she does not suffer the same disassociation that I do; and that with my cock I appear to be succeeding in engaging her with pleasurable impact. 

Yet still, I know somehow that I am about to cum. I hold her on my cock, rammed deeply up her tight cunt. And my orgasm approaches slowly, and then tips over and slides down a cliff. Time expands and my orgasm goes on and on, I watch it happening, though really, I can hardly feel anything. She pumps her hips against me though because _she_ can feel my cock throbbing and filling her. All I want is to watch her orgasm, and if cum spurting from my cock filling her contributes to her pleasure, then so much the better.

But as my orgasm fades, the blackness grows and grows. It swallows us both. It fully consumes her, sucking her back down, and leaves me alone with nothing by my still-raging dick, the tip throbbing in the air and white cum dripping slowly from it down into the void.
